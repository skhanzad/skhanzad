### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Artificial Intelligence researcher and software engineer with a passion for creating innovative and practical solutions using cutting-edge technologies. I have a strong background in machine learning, natural language processing, and software development, and I enjoy applying these skills to real-world problems.

On my GitHub page, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate my expertise in AI and software engineering. These projects range from simple algorithms and tools to more complex systems and applications, and they showcase my ability to apply my knowledge and skills to a wide range of domains.

In addition to my own projects, I'm also an active member of the open-source community, and I enjoy collaborating with others on projects and contributing to existing projects.
